# Automated-detection-and-repair-of-layout-bugs-in-webpages

This code is part of a project of automatic detection and repair of layout bugs that can occur in web pages. The work can be found there: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-74296-6\_32

My contribution is about the mathematical modelization of such problems into a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and the way it should formulated in CPLEX. It lead to the file Source/Core/src/ca/uqac/lif/pagen/OplRendere.java that was co-written with Xavier Chamberland-Thibeault and Sylvain Hall√© (UQAC).
